**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Camera Calibration

The code for this step is contained in the first code cell located in `./code/src/functions.py` in lines 7 through 45.

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image (thresholding steps at lines 48 through 143 in `./code/src/functions.py`).  Here's an example of my output for this step.

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warp()`, which appears in lines 146 through 188 in the file `./code/src/functions.py`.  The `warp()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```python
src = np.float32([(575,464),
                (707,464), 
                (258,682), 
                (1049,682)])
dst = np.float32([(450,0),
                (img_size[0]-300,0),
                (450,img_size[1]),
                (img_size[0]-300,img_size[1])])
```

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 575, 464      | 450, 0        | 
| 707, 464      | 980, 0        |
| 258, 682      | 450, 720      |
| 1049, 682     | 980, 720      |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Then I write the `hist()` (from line 198 to line 205 in `./code/src/functions.py`) to make the histogram of the activated pixels. Then I write a function `find_lane_pixels` (from line 208 to line 289 in `./code/src/functions.py`). At last, I write a function `fit_polynomial` (from line 291 to line 341 in `./code/src/functions.py`)and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:

![alt text][image5]

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I write a function `measure_curvature_real` (from line 411 to line 425 in `./code/src/functions.py`) to measure the radius of the curvature of the road and I write a function `measure_center_dist_real` (from line 427 to line 440 in `./code/src/functions.py`) to measure the potision of the vehicle with respect to center.

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented `./code/static_image_process.py`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](https://github.com/Roger-Mei/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/test_videos_output/solidWhiteRight2.mp4)

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Issue when implement perspective transformation: It is not reasonable to arbitarily choose four points to do the perspective transformation on `src` and `dst`. For the convenience of computing the car's distance to lane center, we should choose the bottom of center vertical line as one `src` point and project it on the `dst`.

Issues before adding a look-ahead fileter: The performance of the pipeline is slow and not stable, especially in the image where there is an interseciton between the lane line and the shadows of the tree. With shadow involved, the detected lanes are extremely twsted. With a look-ahead filter, the issue is well resolved: with a narrowed searching horizon, it saves a lot computation time. Also, if the curvature or end point of polynomial changes drastically, the program will choose the previous solution, which will prevent the distortion caused by the shadow.

Issues with cracked lanes: Although look-ahead filter resolve the issue of the shadow, it stll doesn't resolve the complicated lane condition, like cracked lane lines in challenge videos. Also, the current program doesn't have the capability of solving the side shadow scenario, where a sharp gradient is also involved.
